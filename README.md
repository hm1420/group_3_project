# group_3_project

Rianna: 
Create a tic tac toe board and add a piece using a random move (board.py)

Ana: Completed the code for the game based on Rianna's work, added 3 strategy's (random, medium and smart) and created plots that show the efficiency of each strategy (in gameXO.py). Added another more efficient code with similar strategies, which is based on arrays (instead of strings) in the file plot_games.py
