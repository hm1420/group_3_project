# group_3_project

Rianna: 
Create a tic tac toe board and add a piece using a random move

Ana: Completed the code for the game based on Rianna's work, added 3 strategy's (random, medium and smart) and created plots that show the efficiency of each strategy. Added another more efficient code with similar strategies, which is based on arrays (instead of strings)
