# group_3_project

## Rianna: 
Created a tic tac toe board and add a piece using a random move (board.py)

## Ana: 
Completed the code for the game based on Rianna's work, added 3 strategy's (random, medium and smart) and created plots that show the efficiency of each strategy (in gameXO.py). Added another more efficient code with similar strategies, which is based on arrays (instead of strings) in the file plot_games.py

## Dan

## Hashir:
Created a class used in the final code to obtain a strategy based on regret matching and then choosing an action based on the obtained strategy (since the strategy is a probability distribution).
